# Gas's dotfiles

Top secret text files that make my world a better place. :')


## A Word of Advice

Before you use these (or any) dotfiles, make sure you back your dotfiles up into a directory (you'll find them in your home folder - type `ls -a` in the terminal).

Dotfiles are meant to be different. What suits me well definitely won't be perfect for you. So I seriously recommend forking this repo and then making it your own.
